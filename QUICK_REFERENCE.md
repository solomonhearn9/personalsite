# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference Card - Keep This Handy!

## THE 30-SECOND OPENER

> "Hey, I'm Solomon â€” I'm a local software engineer from Cambridge who's been helping nearby dental practices modernize their online presence. I just finished a project for another Cambridge dentist, and I noticed your practice could be getting a lot more patient calls every month. Would Dr. [Name] be open to a quick 10-minute chat sometime about what's working best locally right now?"

## WHAT YOU DO (Not "web design"!)

"I help dental practices turn their website and Google presence into a **patient-generating machine**. Most practices lose 60% of potential patients because their online setup isn't optimized for local searches. I fix that systematically."

## THE "LOCAL FOUNDERS RATE" PITCH

"I'm working with a small number of Cambridge & Boston practices to build local case studies before I scale my pricing â€” so I'm offering a **reduced early rate this quarter**. Once I have 5-6 strong case studies, my rates will go up significantly."

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

**"We don't have budget"**  
â†’ "Could I do a quick 15-minute audit of your Google Business Profile? Show you 2-3 specific things you're losing patients on â€” no cost, no obligation."

**"We already have someone"**  
â†’ "That's great! How's it going? Are you seeing measurable increases in patient calls?" (Listen) "Happy to offer a second opinion if you ever need one."

**"Let me think about it"**  
â†’ "Absolutely! Can I send you a link to my work? Shows the Cambridge practice I just wrapped up. I'm only taking 2-3 more clients this quarter."

**"How much does this cost?"**  
â†’ "Depends on what you need â€” typically $3,500-5,000 one-time for full setup, or $2,000-2,500/month ongoing. Can tailor based on where you're at. Want a 15-min call?"
