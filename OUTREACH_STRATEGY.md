‚úÖ "I'll optimize your Google Business Profile so you rank #1 for 'dentist near me in Cambridge'"

### **Use Social Proof Constantly:**
‚ùå "I'm really good at this"

### **Always Have a Next Step:**

## üß† Mindset Reminders

### **You Are Not Begging for Work**
You're offering a valuable solution to a real problem. Most dentists are literally losing thousands per month in revenue because their online presence isn't optimized.

### **You Have Legitimate Credentials**
- Walmart software engineer (Fortune 1)
- Vanderbilt CS grad
- Real Cambridge client with 240% results
- Local market knowledge

### **Rejection Is Normal**
You'll get more "no's" than "yes's" ‚Äî that's the game. Every "no" gets you closer to the next "yes." Goal: 10-15 visits = 3-5 interested = 1-2 clients.

### **Be Confident, Not Cocky**
Confidence: "I've helped a Cambridge dentist get 240% more calls. I can probably help you too."
Cocky: "I'm the best and you'd be stupid not to hire me."

### **Local Advantage Is Huge**
Very few people walk into dental offices in person anymore. You showing up, being local, understanding Cambridge/Boston market ‚Äî that's a massive differentiator.

## üìû Emergency Contact Script (If You Freeze)

If you walk in and forget your pitch:

> "Hi! I'm Solomon, a local software engineer. I've been helping Cambridge dental practices get more patient calls through their website and Google listing. I just finished a project for another Cambridge dentist, and I thought I'd stop by to see if Dr. [Name] might be interested in learning about what we're seeing work best locally. Is there a good time to catch them for a quick chat?"

Then hand them your card or get their email.
