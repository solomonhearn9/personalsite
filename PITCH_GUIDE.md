# In-Person Dental Practice Pitch Guide

## Quick Reference for Walking into Cambridge/Boston Dental Offices

## THE 30-SECOND OPENER (At Reception Desk)

> "Hey, I'm Solomon â€” I'm a local software engineer from Cambridge who's been helping nearby dental practices modernize their online presence. I just finished a project for another Cambridge dentist, and I noticed your practice's website and Google listing could be getting you a lot more patient calls every month. Would Dr. [Name] be open to a quick 10-minute chat sometime about what's working best locally right now?"

**Key Points:**
- Establish local credibility ("Cambridge")
- Drop social proof ("another Cambridge dentist")
- Be specific ("more patient calls")
- Low commitment ask ("10-minute chat")

---

## IF THEY ASK "WHAT DO YOU DO?"

**DON'T SAY:** "I'm a web designer" or "I build websites"

**DO SAY:** 
> "I help dental practices turn their website and Google presence into a patient-generating machine. Most dentists lose 60% of potential patients because their online setup isn't optimized for local searches. I fix that systematically â€” my last Cambridge client saw 240% more patient calls in 60 days."

## SHOW YOUR PHONE/IPAD

Pull up: **`dental-practices.html`** page
- Shows both dental examples with screenshots
- Displays credentials prominently
- Mobile-optimized for quick viewing
- Has clear results (240% increase, etc.)

Alternative: Show `index.html` (homepage) which now leads with dental focus

## KEY TALKING POINTS (Use Naturally)

### Your Background (Build Trust)
- "I used to work in software engineering at Walmart, but I realized local dental practices weren't taking advantage of the same growth tools we used in tech."
- "I studied Computer Science at Vanderbilt â€” so I approach this with an engineering mindset, not just design."
- "I'm local to Cambridge/Boston, so you get in-person support and someone who understands this market."

### What You Do (Paint the Picture)
- "I integrate your website, Google Business Profile, and simple automations to drive more patient bookings â€” even while you're busy treating patients."
- "Most practices aren't showing up when someone searches 'dentist near me' in Cambridge. That's a massive missed opportunity."
- "I track everything: which searches bring patients, which pages convert, where the drop-off happens. No guesswork."

### Results Focus (What They Care About)
- "On average, optimized practices in Cambridge get 3â€“5x more calls from Google within 90 days."
- "My recent Cambridge client went from maybe 2-3 web inquiries per week to 10-12 per week."
- "The goal isn't a pretty website â€” it's more patient appointments on your schedule."

### Overcome "We Already Have a Website"
- "That's great! My focus is actually on what happens after someone finds your site â€” are they calling? Booking? Or bouncing to a competitor?"
- "Most dental websites look fine but don't convert visitors into appointments. That's the gap I fix."

---

## THE "LOCAL FOUNDERS RATE" PITCH

> "I'm working with a small number of Cambridge & Boston practices to build local case studies before I scale my pricing â€” so I'm offering a reduced early rate this quarter. Once I have 5-6 strong case studies, my rates will go up significantly."

**Why This Works:**
- Creates urgency ("limited spots")
- Explains why you're affordable (not desperate)
- Positions you as scaling up (credible trajectory)
- Makes them feel special ("early adopter")

## HANDLING COMMON OBJECTIONS

### "We don't have budget right now"
"I totally understand. Could I do a quick 15-minute audit of your Google Business Profile? I'll show you 2-3 specific things you're losing patients on right now â€” no cost, no obligation. Then if it makes sense, we can talk about working together down the line."

### "We're already working with someone"
"That's great! How's it going? Are you seeing measurable increases in patient calls?" (Listen) "Well, if you ever want a second opinion or fresh perspective, I'm happy to do a quick competitive audit â€” just takes 10 minutes."

### "Let me think about it"
"Absolutely! Can I leave you my card and maybe send you a link to my credibility page? Shows the Cambridge practice I just wrapped up. No pressure â€” but I'm only taking on 2-3 more dental clients this quarter."

### "How much does this cost?"
"It depends on what you need, but typically I work in 2 ways:
1. Full website + SEO + Google optimization: Starting around $3,500-5,000 one-time
2. Ongoing growth partnership: Around $2,000-2,500/month

But I can tailor it based on where you're at. Want to hop on a 15-minute call this week?"

## SAME-DAY FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Quick intro - Solomon from earlier today

Hi Dr. [Name],

Great meeting you briefly today! As mentioned, I help Cambridge & Boston dental practices get more patient calls through strategic website and Google Business optimization.

I just wrapped up a project for another Cambridge dentist who saw a 240% increase in patient inquiries within 60 days. Happy to show you exactly what we did and how it might apply to your practice.

Here's a quick overview of my work: [link to dental-practices.html]

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week? I can do a quick audit of your Google presence and show you 2-3 specific opportunities you're missing right now.

Best,
Solomon H

## TRACKING YOUR VISITS

Keep a simple spreadsheet:
- Date visited
- Practice name
- Dentist name
- Spoke with (receptionist/office manager/dentist)
- Response (interested/not interested/follow up)
- Follow-up action
- Next step date

Goal: **Visit 2-3 practices per day**

---

## PRE-VISIT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Charged phone/iPad
- [ ] Dental-practices.html page loads quickly
- [ ] Business cards (if you have them)
- [ ] Dressed professionally but approachable
- [ ] Confident but not pushy energy
- [ ] Practiced 30-second opener
- [ ] Know their practice name/dentist name (Google it first)
- [ ] Check their Google Business Profile beforehand (you can reference specific issues)

---

## CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**Remember:**
1. You have legit credentials (Walmart, Vanderbilt)
2. You have a real Cambridge client with real results
3. You know this market (local)
4. Dental practices NEED what you're offering
5. Most "web designers" can't do what you do
6. You're offering real value, not selling snake oil

**Mindset:**
You're not begging for work â€” you're offering a valuable solution to a real problem. Most dentists are losing thousands in potential revenue every month because their online presence sucks. You're helping them fix that.

---

## POST-VISIT REFLECTION

After each visit, note:
- What went well?
- What could I improve?
- Did I feel confident?
- How did they respond to X talking point?
- What objections came up?

Adjust your approach based on what you learn.
